Provider skill for ovos-common-reading-pipeline-plugin: implements the
ovos.common_reading.* bus protocol and registers NO intents of its own.
See https://github.com/andlo/ovos-common-reading-pipeline-plugin for the
full protocol - this skill has no standalone voice interface, it needs
the pipeline plugin installed and configured to be useful.

The story INDEX (title/anchor per story) is bundled with this package
(see locale/fr-fr/index.json), built once via scripts/build_index.py -
browsing/matching needs no internet at all. Internet is only needed when
actually fetching a specific story's text from Project Gutenberg.
